# Installation / usage
If you want to run the slides locally, then you need to:

1. Install nodejs (I would recommend to do it via nvm or a similar tool, use latest *stable* version)
2. Go to the directory where the project was cloned and run following commands.
3. npm install
4. npm install jspm -g
5. jspm install
6. npm start

# Content
This repository will basically contain some of my slides shown in scope of internal tech talks in my company. Have fun exploring those : )

(When there is time I will try to extend this description to provide more details on included presentations)
